# Code Style & Formatting Rules

## Formatting Standards
- Follow the .editorconfig file for consistent formatting

- Use PascalCase for public members, camelCase for private fields
- Interface names must be prefixed with 'I'

- Constants and static readonly fields use PascalCase
- Private fields use camelCase with underscore prefix (e.g., _fieldName)

## Automatic Formatting
